## Key Production Features

### High Availability
- Multiple replicas (10 minimum)
- Pod anti-affinity for distribution across nodes
- Pod disruption budgets for graceful updates
- Health checks with appropriate timeouts

### Scalability
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler with 10-40 replica range
- Lower scaling thresholds (60%) for faster response
- Resource requests/limits optimized for production workloads

### Performance
- Increased memory and CPU allocation
- Optimized connection pools and timeouts
- 50MB body size limits for large payloads
- Production-optimized health check intervals

### Reliability
- Circuit breaker configurations
- Retry mechanisms with appropriate backoffs
- Failure mode configurations for graceful degradation
- Enhanced logging and monitoring

## Deployment Notes

### Prerequisites
- Ensure cluster has sufficient resources for 10-40 pods per service
- Verify nodes can accommodate 8-16Gi memory requests
- Check network policies allow required communication

### Monitoring
- ServiceMonitor enabled for Envoy
- Prometheus annotations configured
- Health check endpoints exposed

### Security
- Non-root containers
- Read-only root filesystem
- Dropped capabilities
- Security contexts configured

## Configuration Files Updated
1. `values-rls.yaml` - RLS production configuration
2. `values-envoy.yaml` - Envoy production configuration
3. `charts/mimir-rls/templates/deployment.yaml` - Already handles 50MB limits properly

## Next Steps
1. Deploy with production values: `helm upgrade -f values-rls.yaml -f values-envoy.yaml`
2. Monitor resource usage and scaling behavior
3. Adjust limits based on actual production load
4. Consider Redis backend for shared state across RLS pods
