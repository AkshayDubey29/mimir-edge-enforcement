# Problem Statement - Mimir Edge Enforcement

## Overview

This document outlines the critical challenges and pain points that the Mimir Edge Enforcement system addresses in modern observability and monitoring environments.

## Business Challenges

### 1. Uncontrolled Infrastructure Costs

#### Problem
- **Exponential Cost Growth**: Monitoring infrastructure costs growing 300-500% year-over-year
- **No Visibility**: Lack of real-time visibility into cost drivers and usage patterns
- **Budget Overruns**: Monthly infrastructure bills exceeding allocated budgets by 200-400%
- **Resource Waste**: 40-60% of monitoring resources consumed by non-critical or duplicate data

#### Impact
- **Financial**: $500K - $2M annual overspend on monitoring infrastructure
- **Operational**: Delayed feature development due to cost constraints
- **Strategic**: Reduced investment in core business initiatives

#### Root Causes
- No centralized rate limiting or quota enforcement
- Inability to differentiate between critical and non-critical metrics
- Lack of tenant-aware resource allocation
- Missing cost attribution and chargeback mechanisms

### 2. Service Reliability Degradation

#### Problem
- **Performance Degradation**: 30-50% increase in query response times during peak loads
- **Service Outages**: 2-3 major outages per quarter due to resource exhaustion
- **Cascading Failures**: Single tenant's excessive usage affecting all users
- **Resource Contention**: CPU and memory contention leading to service degradation

#### Impact
- **User Experience**: 40-60% increase in support tickets during peak periods
- **Business Continuity**: Critical business operations disrupted during outages
- **Reputation**: Customer trust and satisfaction impacted by service instability

#### Root Causes
- No protection against resource abuse
- Missing circuit breakers and throttling mechanisms
- Inadequate resource isolation between tenants
- Lack of proactive monitoring and alerting

### 3. Operational Complexity

#### Problem
- **Manual Interventions**: 15-20 hours per week spent on manual resource management
- **Reactive Operations**: 80% of operational work is reactive rather than proactive
- **Knowledge Silos**: Critical operational knowledge concentrated in few team members
- **Inconsistent Policies**: Different rate limiting policies across environments

#### Impact
- **Productivity**: 25-30% of engineering time spent on operational tasks
- **Scalability**: Operations team unable to scale with business growth
- **Risk**: High dependency on individual team members

#### Root Causes
- No automated enforcement mechanisms
- Missing centralized policy management
- Lack of standardized operational procedures
- Insufficient tooling for proactive management

## Technical Challenges

### 1. Distributed Rate Limiting

#### Problem
- **Inconsistent Enforcement**: Rate limits applied differently across services
- **State Management**: Complex distributed state management for rate limiting
- **Latency Impact**: Rate limiting decisions adding 50-100ms to request latency
- **Scalability Issues**: Rate limiting not scaling with traffic growth

#### Technical Details
```yaml
# Current State - Inconsistent Rate Limiting
services:
  - name: service-a
    rate_limit: 1000 req/sec
    window: 1 minute
  - name: service-b
    rate_limit: 500 req/sec
    window: 5 minutes
  - name: service-c
    rate_limit: none  # No rate limiting
```

#### Impact
- **Reliability**: Inconsistent service behavior
- **Performance**: Unpredictable latency patterns
- **Maintenance**: Complex configuration management

### 2. Multi-Tenant Resource Management

#### Problem
- **Resource Isolation**: Poor isolation between tenant workloads
- **Fair Sharing**: No fair resource allocation mechanisms
- **Quota Enforcement**: Inability to enforce tenant-specific quotas
- **Usage Tracking**: Limited visibility into per-tenant resource consumption

#### Technical Details
```yaml
# Current State - No Tenant Isolation
resources:
  cpu: shared_pool
  memory: shared_pool
  storage: shared_pool
  network: shared_pool

# Desired State - Tenant-Aware Allocation
resources:
  tenant_a:
    cpu: 20%
    memory: 2GB
    storage: 100GB
  tenant_b:
    cpu: 30%
    memory: 4GB
    storage: 200GB
```

#### Impact
- **Fairness**: Some tenants consuming disproportionate resources
- **Predictability**: Unpredictable performance for all tenants
- **Compliance**: Difficulty meeting SLA commitments

### 3. Real-Time Decision Making

#### Problem
- **Latency Requirements**: Need sub-10ms decision latency for rate limiting
- **Accuracy**: High accuracy requirements for enforcement decisions
- **Consistency**: Need consistent decisions across distributed components
- **Scalability**: Must handle 10K+ requests per second

#### Technical Details
```yaml
# Current State - High Latency Decisions
decision_flow:
  request_received: 0ms
  policy_lookup: 50ms
  rate_limit_check: 100ms
  decision_made: 150ms
  response_sent: 200ms

# Desired State - Low Latency Decisions
decision_flow:
  request_received: 0ms
  policy_lookup: 2ms
  rate_limit_check: 5ms
  decision_made: 8ms
  response_sent: 10ms
```

#### Impact
- **User Experience**: Poor response times
- **Throughput**: Limited system capacity
- **Cost**: Higher infrastructure costs due to inefficiency

## Security Challenges

- **Compliance**: Failure to meet security compliance requirements

### 2. Audit and Compliance

#### Problem

- **Forensic Analysis**: Limited ability to investigate security incidents
- **Policy Enforcement**: No verification of policy compliance

#### Compliance Requirements
- **SOC 2**: Security controls and monitoring
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry compliance

## Scalability Challenges
