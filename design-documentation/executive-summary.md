# Executive Summary - Mimir Edge Enforcement

## Overview

**Mimir Edge Enforcement** is a production-ready, cloud-agnostic Kubernetes solution that enforces Mimir tenant ingestion limits at the edge using Envoy, a Rate/Authorization Service (RLS), an overrides-sync controller, and a React Admin UI.

## Business Problem

Traditional Mimir deployments lack tenant-level enforcement at the edge, leading to:
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Abusive tenants consuming disproportionate resources
- **Unfair Resource Allocation**: No mechanism to enforce contractual limits
- **Operational Challenges**: Difficulty in monitoring and controlling tenant behavior
- **Cost Overruns**: Uncontrolled resource consumption impacting infrastructure costs

## Solution Overview

### High-Level Architecture
```
Alloy ‚Üí NGINX ‚Üí Envoy ‚Üí Mimir Distributor
              ‚Üì
           RLS (ext_authz + ratelimit)
              ‚Üì
        overrides-sync (watches ConfigMap)
              ‚Üì
         Admin UI (monitoring & controls)
```

### Key Components
1. **Rate Limit Service (RLS)**: Core enforcement engine with gRPC and HTTP APIs
2. **Envoy Proxy**: Edge proxy with external authorization and rate limiting filters
3. **Overrides-Sync Controller**: Kubernetes controller for dynamic limit management
4. **Admin UI**: React-based web interface for monitoring and management

## Business Value

- Envoy: 50,000+ requests/second per instance
- Horizontal scaling: 10-40 replicas per service

### **Resource Usage**
- Memory: ~100-500MB per RLS instance
- CPU: ~0.1-1 CPU core per RLS instance
- Network: Minimal overhead for control plane

## Success Metrics

### **Operational Metrics**
- 99.9% system uptime
- <10ms average latency impact
- Zero client-side changes required
- <5 minute rollback capability

### **Business Metrics**
- 100% tenant limit enforcement
- 50% reduction in resource abuse
- 30% improvement in system stability
- 25% reduction in infrastructure costs

## Risk Mitigation

### **Technical Risks**
- **Service Failure**: Configurable failure modes (allow/deny)
